5 steps to Dynamic Programming:

1) define subproblems -> # subproblems
2) guess (part of the solution) -> # of choices for guess
3) relate subproblem solutions -> time/subproblem
4) recurse & memoize OR build DP table bottom up -> check subproblem recurrence
                                                    is acyclic i.e. has topological
                                                    sort
5) solve original problem
